##  PA-1 — **Nth Prime Number Using a Formula (Python)**

### **Objective**

Construct a formula that transforms a prime detector into a prime computer

Implement and test the formula

Analyze and compare time complexity with Willans’ formula

### **Approach**

* **Wilson’s Theorem** is used to detect primality:
  [(p - 1)! ≡ -1 (mod\ p)] if and only if `p` is prime
* A recursively memoized prime-counting function π(x) keeps the solution efficient
* Rosser–Schoenfeld upper bound ensures the algorithm stops at or before the nth prime
* The formula computes:
  nth_prime = 2 + ∑ (from i = 2 to U)  floor( ( n / ( π(i) + 1 ) ) ^ (1/n) )
  
| Symbol    | Meaning                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `n`       | The target prime index                   |
| `U`       | Rosser–Schoenfeld upper bound            |
| `π(i)`    | Number of primes less than or equal to i |
| `floor()` | Integer floor function                   |



### **Time Complexity Discussion**

| Formula             | Complexity                                                                           | Remarks                                                     |

| Willans’ Formula    | **Exponential / factorial growth**                                                   | Impractical                                                 |
| This implementation | **Significantly lower; dominated by Wilson modular factorial check + repeated π(i)** | Still mathematically interesting, not optimized for large n |

While this method is still slower than modern sieves, it **successfully demonstrates transformation from detector → computer**, which is the key learning goal of PA-1.

### **Execution**

```bash
python pa1.py
```

Provide an input `n`:

```
Enter n to find nth prime: 20
20th prime = 71
```

##  PA-2 — **Extract ECC Curve Equation & Field Characteristic (Python)**

### **Objective**

Export and analyze a live website’s SSL certificate

Extract the **elliptic curve equation parameters**

Extract the **characteristic of the finite field**

This relates to **EC-DSA digital signatures**, widely deployed in modern authentication (HTTPS certificates, identity verification, etc.) — as referenced in the assignment description .

### **How the Program Works**

* Loads `.crt` in **PEM or DER** format
* Identifies the ECC curve used (e.g., `secp256r1`)
* Retrieves:

  * **a** (curve parameter)
  * **b** (curve parameter)
  * **p** (prime modulus, i.e., characteristic of GF(p))
* Outputs elliptic curve equation:

[
y^2 \equiv x^3 + ax + b \mod p
]

### **Execution**

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install cryptography tinyec
```

Run the script:

```bash
python pa2.py
```

Example output:

```
